## Overview
When I was younger, before I knew much at all about computers, I would watch YouTube videos of people playing Pokemon games on their computer. I always wondered how it is they were playing on their computer and capturing the footage, and it wasn't until of years later I learned about emulation. Since then, emulation has been a hobby and passion of mine, and when I needed a project during COVID lockdown, I decided to build an emulator of my favorite console from my childhood, the Nintendo Gameboy Advance.

## Features

- Full emulation of the GBA's CPU, the ARM7-HDMI
- Emulation of the GBA's hardware, including memory bus, audio processing, graphics processing, and interrupt system
- High and low level (HLE/LLE) emulation of GBA's software interrupts
- Bootable and playable with a large number of commerical and homebrew GBA ROMs
