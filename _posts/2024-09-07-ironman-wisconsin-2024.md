It has been a goal of mine to compete in an Ironman Triathlon for several years. Today, I accomplished that goal at Ironman Wisconsin in Madison, WI. An Ironman is a triathlon that consists of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run all in one day. The event started at 7am and I finished a bit before midnight. Despite how grueling it sounds, it was one of the best days of my life and a day I'll remember forever!

The road to the finish line began almost a year prior when I comitted to do the event and signed up. I ramped up my training over the course of the year and by the time of the event a typical training week looked like this:
- 6 days on, 1 day off
- 10 sessions averging 60-90 minutes per session
- 2-3 swims
- 3 runs
- 4 bikes

Although I was fit and extremely prepared for the event, the daunting distances made me question my capability to complete the race. I distinctly remember being 40 miles into the bike leg, feeling amazing, and thinking to myself, *"I'm going to finish this race. I'm going to be an Ironman."* I rode the remainder of the ride and ran the entirety of the marathon with a smile on my face. I can't wait to do it again.

The only thing that needs to change is your mindset. Anything is possible!
